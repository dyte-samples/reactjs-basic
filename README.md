# Dyte ReactJS Sample

This project is a bare minimum sample to showcase Dyte Video SDK integration with ReactJS application.

It uses Meeting Room Name and Auth Token to authenticate the user and start the meeting. These details are returned after successful call to `Create Meeting` and `Add Paricipant` APIs.

When application is executed, it will look like:

You can use Stoplight on [Dyte Documentation](https://docs.dyte.io/) or Postman collection to try these APIs:
